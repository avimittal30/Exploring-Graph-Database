# Graph Database Querying with Neo4j and LangChain

This demonstration showcases how to utilize a graph database, specifically Neo4j, for querying relationships using natural language inputs via the LangChain library.

## Key Components

- **Neo4j Database**: A leading graph database that models data as nodes, relationships, and properties, making it ideal for handling highly connected data.
  
- **LangChain**: A framework that integrates with language models to simplify interaction with graph databases.

## Process Overview

1. **Setup**: Initialize a Neo4j connection and configure the `GraphCypherQAChain` with an OpenAI GPT-4 model.
   
2. **Natural Language Querying**: Use the `invoke` method of the chain to input natural language queries (e.g., "Which games have the same publisher in the year 2003?").
   
3. **Cypher Query Generation**: The chain translates the natural language input into a Cypher query that is executed against the Neo4j database.
   
4. **Result Retrieval**: The database returns pairs of games published in the specified year by the same publisher, which are then formatted into a user-friendly output.

## Example Output

For the query about games in 2003, the output includes several titles published by Nintendo, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph databases in uncovering complex relationships in data.

## Conclusion

This demonstration highlights the power of combining graph databases with natural language processing, making data querying intuitive and accessible for users unfamiliar with traditional query languages.
